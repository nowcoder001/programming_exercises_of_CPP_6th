/*Write a program that reads in a line of input and then prints the line in reverse order. 
You can store the input in an array of char; assume that the line is no longer than 255 
characters. Recall that you can use scanf() with the %c specifier to read a character at 
a time from input and that the newline character ( \n) is generated when you press the 
Enter key.*/
